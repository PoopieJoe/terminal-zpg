# Terminal-zpg
A zero-player-game played from the terminal

## Description
Game follows main character. Characters can be created manually or randomized. They will traven through the world, and perform quests to gain power to accomplish their ultimate goal. A character's ultimate goal can be to defeat their archnemesis or some great evil, to conquer the world or even end it, to save their love, to become king/queen, to obtain some lost relic, to create something great, or something else entirely.

In principle the player does not need to do anything. The character will take action by itself and may eventually complete their goal. The player can direct a character's actions through the terminal with a set of commands. These commands are usually of a form like "Travel to < Place >", "Use < Item >", "Talk to < Character >", "Kill < Character >". The character will then either stop, or finish whatever they are doing, and do that thing.

The main character will develop relationships with other entities, not limited to: other characters, cities, counties, empires, religions, gods, etc. This will influence how the character reacts to the world, and how the world reacts to the character. Chracter alignment does not exist explicitly, but flows forth from the character and how their relationships with the world develop over time.

The character has equipment and abilities that are obtained throughout the characters travels. Equipment has durability that diminishes over time. When durability runs out, the equipment breaks. Equipment can be maintained and upgraded at the cost of money. Abilities are powers or spells that can be used on a cooldown. For instance, "Firebolt" can be used to deal damage in combat, or light things on fire, "Second wind" restores hp when the character's HP drops below half, "Pickpocket" can be used to steal money or an item from another character. The maximum number of abilities depends on the level of the character.
